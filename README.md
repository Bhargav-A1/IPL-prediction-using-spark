IPL Score Prediction Using Machine Learning and Big Data
Project Overview
IPL Score Prediction Using Machine Learning and Big Data is a robust analytical solution designed to forecast the final scores of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches with high accuracy. Leveraging advanced regression techniques and data-driven feature engineering, this project harnesses the power of real-time and historical match data to model cricket scoring behavior.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Cleanses and transforms raw match data to extract meaningful features like team statistics, run rate, wickets in hand, and match progression metrics.

Model Implementation
Implements multiple machine learning models including:

* Linear Regression

* Ridge Regression

* Lasso Regression

* Random Forest Regressor

* Decision Tree Regressor

Performance Evaluation
Uses metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score to evaluate model performance and identify the most reliable predictive model.

Intelligent Predictions
Predicts final scores during mid-game (e.g., after 5-15 overs) using contextual match data and regression-based forecasting.

Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Concepts: Machine Learning, Regression Analysis, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering

Use Case
This project serves as a foundation for intelligent sports analytics platforms, fantasy cricket applications, and real-time commentary enhancements by offering predictive insights based on current match conditions.

Future Enhancements
Incorporate Deep Learning for more complex sequence modeling (e.g., LSTM-based models).
Integrate Live Data Streaming via APIs to provide real-time predictions.
Expand features to include player-level metrics and environmental conditions (pitch, weather, etc.).

Contributions
Open to improvements, optimizations, and enhancements. Feel free to fork, contribute, and raise issues for collaboration!
